# Plant Cycle Identification with Satellite Data

Given a farm location, identify the plant growth cycle over the years based on historical data.


## Key Questions
- What kind of information can provide the most insight?
- How can we use these features to determine the likelihood of plants?
- How can we bring together various perspectives to identify the plant growing cycle?

## Background
The plants are classified by the number of growing seasons required to complete their life cycle. There are three main categories: annuals, biennials and perennials. Annuals provides continues blooms throughout the growing season, while biennials provide blooms during their second year of growth. Perennials will bloom for 2 to 8 weeks or longer, however, bloom time will vary and can occur during the beginning, middle, or end of the growing season.

According to the Food Agriculture Organization statistical database (FAOSTAT), in 2019, there were 16 most important plant species, without which human existence would be completely vulnerable. The importance of these crops was ranked based on the total production of output (tonnes).
