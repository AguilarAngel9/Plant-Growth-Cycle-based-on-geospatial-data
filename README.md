# Plant Cycle Identification with Satellite Data

Given a farm location, identify the plant growth cycle over the years based on historical data.


## Key Questions
- What kind of information can provide the most insight?
- How can we use these features to determine the likelihood of plants?
- How can we bring together various perspectives to identify the plant growing cycle?

## Background
The plants are classified by the number of growing seasons required to complete their life cycle. There are three main categories: annuals, biennials and perennials. Annuals provides continues blooms throughout the growing season, while biennials provide blooms during their second year of growth. Perennials will bloom for 2 to 8 weeks or longer, however, bloom time will vary and can occur during the beginning, middle, or end of the growing season.

According to the Food Agriculture Organization statistical database (FAOSTAT), in 2019, there were 16 most important plant species, without which human existence would be completely vulnerable. The importance of these crops was ranked based on the total production of output (tonnes).

## Vulnerability of Food Resources to Climate

### Perennial crops
Winkler *et al* states that the vulnerability of perennial crops has not been investigated as much as that of annual crops. Mainly, because the perennial crop production is frequently constrained to areas with unique local or regional climates that are often influenced by topographic position, proximity to water bodies, or the presence of mesoscale atmospheric circulations and weather conditions such as frequent fog that modify the local climate.

> The fruit crops most investigated are wine grapes, apple, cherry, citrus, peach, apricot, kiwi, mango, pear, pineapple, plum, and strawberry.

Perennial crops are particularly vulnerable to cold damage at three distinct stages: (1) in the fall before the tree is adequately hardened, (2) during the winter dormant period when severe cold events can cause injury to woody tissue, and (3) during spring when temperatures slightly
below freezing may kill flower buds following the loss of cold
hardiness *(Raseira and Moore 1987)*.

There are other problems that perennial crops have to face as a consequence of climate change, among which we can find winter chill fulfillment, springtime freeze risk, pollination constraints, heat stress, disease and insect pest damage.
