# Plant Cycle Identification with Satellite Data

Given a farm location, identify the plant growth cycle over the years based on historical data.


## Key Questions
- What kind of information can provide the most insight?
- How can we use these features to determine the likelihood of plants?
- How can we bring together various perspectives to identify the plant growing cycle?

## Background
The plants are classified by the number of growing seasons required to complete their life cycle. There are three main categories: annuals, biennials and perennials. Annuals provides continues blooms throughout the growing season, while biennials provide blooms during their second year of growth. Perennials will bloom for 2 to 8 weeks or longer, however, bloom time will vary and can occur during the beginning, middle, or end of the growing season.

According to the Food Agriculture Organization statistical database (FAOSTAT), in 2019, there were 16 most important plant species, without which human existence would be completely vulnerable. The importance of these crops was ranked based on the total production of output (tonnes).

### Most important plants for humankind

1. Sugarcane (annual)
2. Maize (annual)
3. Paddy (annual)
4. Wheat (annual)
5. Potatoes (annual)

## Vulnerability of Food Resources to Climate

### Perennial crops
Winkler *et al* states that the vulnerability of perennial crops has not been investigated as much as that of annual crops. Mainly, because the perennial crop production is frequently constrained to areas with unique local or regional climates that are often influenced by topographic position, proximity to water bodies, or the presence of mesoscale atmospheric circulations and weather conditions such as frequent fog that modify the local climate.

> The fruit crops most investigated are wine grapes, apple, cherry, citrus, peach, apricot, kiwi, mango, pear, pineapple, plum, and strawberry.

Perennial crops are particularly vulnerable to cold damage at three distinct stages: (1) in the fall before the tree is adequately hardened, (2) during the winter dormant period when severe cold events can cause injury to woody tissue, and (3) during spring when temperatures slightly
below freezing may kill flower buds following the loss of cold
hardiness *(Raseira and Moore 1987)*.

There are other problems that perennial crops have to face as a consequence of climate change, among which we can find winter chill fulfillment, springtime freeze risk, pollination constraints, heat stress, disease and insect pest damage.

### Anuals crops
Temperature is a major determinant of the rate of plant development and, under climate change, warmer temperatures that shorten development stages of determinate crops will most probably reduce the yield of a given variety. In that sense, crop production is inherently sensitive to variability in climate. For example, the yield of wheat declined by 5–8% per 1°C rise in mean seasonal temperature. Also, earlier crop flowering and maturity have been observed and documented in recent decades, and these are often associated with warmer (spring) temperatures.

## Growth phases
At the moment of having a crop we have to analyze its growth through the phases of growth that it has. These phases are considered already once the seed is sown, that is, already when the plant was born / transplanted in the land of interest. We have that the growth phases are divided into 3: Rapid growth, Hardening and Establishment phase.
-Establishment phase.
Duration of 14 to 21 days to germinate and 4 to 8 weeks of initial growth.
It is where the seed is just planted and is expected to have the first sprout, where we first ensure that the roots develop properly in case of being in a container and then be transplanted.
-Rapid growth
Varies according to the crop and the conditions it goes around 8 to 20 weeks.
As it indicates, the plants (buds) grow in a very fast way, this from nutrients or chemicals applied.
-Hardening 
1 to 4 months depending on the crop 
This is where the energy of the plant is focused on the growth of the stem and roots so that it has a firm foundation and has a better chance of survival. In this phase the plants are prepared to withstand different conditions (withstand stress).

Besides this, it is important to consider the factors of irrigation, fertilization, spraying and temperature that the crop is receiving.


## What's have been done?

Most of the empirical climate change economics literature uses cross-section/time-series econometrics modeling to estimate the response of crop yields to weather shocks. One exception is the employ of long-differences approach to highlight that adjustments of maize and soybean cultivation in the United States (US) over time-frames of decades or more have resulted in only modest attenuation of the adverse effects of extreme heat exposures on yield losses.

## Images detection

It is possible to detect the products grown on farmland before the end of the growing season using time series of satellite images and with different classification models such as radom forest and super vector machine. For this, it is necessary to know the availability in precise spaces and in real time on the farmland. This information is obtained through satellite images that cover the crop field in past seasons and current time to generate planning based on data.

## The project as Climate AI.
Climate AI currently has four main solutions available to its customers: *Processors and packers*, *Seed input and chemical companies*, *Agriculture Finance* and *Retailers, Co-ops, Crop Advisors*. These products are mainly focused on predictions of the input of the crops, identification of optimal location for selected crops and forecasting of prices and demand of the product. Nevertheless, we identified that just one handle the plants lyfe cycle and, as we believe, that cares only about annual crops. Meanwhile, as *Winkler (2022)* states climate assessments for perenial crops heavily rely on empirical relationships developed between climate observations and plant phenology, and, less frequently, between climate observations and yield.
