# Plant Cycle Identification with Satellite Data

Given a farm location, identify the plant growth cycle over the years based on historical data.


## Key Questions
- What kind of information can provide the most insight?
- How can we use these features to determine the likelihood of plants?
- How can we bring together various perspectives to identify the plant growing cycle?

## Background
The plants are classified by the number of growing seasons required to complete their life cycle. There are three main categories: annuals, biennials and perennials. Annuals provides continues blooms throughout the growing season, while biennials provide blooms during their second year of growth. Perennials will bloom for 2 to 8 weeks or longer, however, bloom time will vary and can occur during the beginning, middle, or end of the growing season.

According to the Food Agriculture Organization statistical database (FAOSTAT), in 2019, there were 16 most important plant species, without which human existence would be completely vulnerable. The importance of these crops was ranked based on the total production of output (tonnes).

### Most important plants for humankind

1. Sugarcane (annual)
2. Maize (annual)
3. Paddy (annual)
4. Wheat (annual)
5. Potatoes (annual)
6. Soybeans (biennial)
7. Oil palm fruit (perennial)
8. Cassava
9. Tomatoes (perennial)
10. Banana (perennial)
11. Sweet potatoes
12. Yams
13. Sorghum
14. Olive (perennial)
15. Natural rubber (perennial)
16. Coffee (perennial)

## Vulnerability of Food Resources to Climate

### Perennial crops
Winkler *et al* states that the vulnerability of perennial crops has not been investigated as much as that of annual crops. Mainly, because the perennial crop production is frequently constrained to areas with unique local or regional climates that are often influenced by topographic position, proximity to water bodies, or the presence of mesoscale atmospheric circulations and weather conditions such as frequent fog that modify the local climate.

> The fruit crops most investigated are wine grapes, apple, cherry, citrus, peach, apricot, kiwi, mango, pear, pineapple, plum, and strawberry.

Perennial crops are particularly vulnerable to cold damage at three distinct stages: (1) in the fall before the tree is adequately hardened, (2) during the winter dormant period when severe cold events can cause injury to woody tissue, and (3) during spring when temperatures slightly
below freezing may kill flower buds following the loss of cold
hardiness *(Raseira and Moore 1987)*.

There are other problems that perennial crops have to face as a consequence of climate change, among which we can find winter chill fulfillment, springtime freeze risk, pollination constraints, heat stress, disease and insect pest damage.

### Anuals crops
Crop production is inherently sensitive to variability in climate. For example,the yield of wheat declined by 5–8% per 1°C rise in mean seasonal temperature.

Temperature is a major determinant of the rate of plant development and, under climate change, warmer temperatures that shorten development stages of determinate crops will most probably reduce the yield of a given variety. Earlier crop flowering and maturity have been observed and documented in recent decades, and these are often associated with warmer (spring) temperatures

## Nonclimatic vulnerabilities
> Economic and social factors
> Consumer demand

## What's have been done?

Most of the empirical climate change economics literature uses cross-section/time-series econometrics modeling to estimate the response of crop yields to weather shocks. One exception is the employ of long-differences approach to highlight that adjustments of maize and soybean cultivation in the United States (US) over time-frames of decades or more have resulted in only modest attenuation of the adverse effects of extreme heat exposures on yield losses.

Climate assessments for perenial crops heavily rely on empirical relationships developed between climate observations and plant phenology, and, less frequently, between climate observations and yield.
